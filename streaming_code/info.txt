This code sends data from following kafka topic to cassandra tables:

"ext_device-event_10121"
"ext_device-telemetry_10121"
"ext_device_10121"
"ext_device-measurement_10121"
"ext_register-statistic_10121"
"ext_device-process_10121"
"ext_device-parameter_10121"
"ext_device-profile-facts_10121"

Issues: 
1. Not getting data for device-profile-facts_10121, device-parameter_10121
2. need to investigate if all of the data that is coming from kafka is going in the cassandra db
